The "Edges" are the toolbars that surround the Card Builder interface:

- The Top Edge is used for navigating through various card modes
- The Left Edge deals with user-specific information
- The Bottom Edge is a way to access shared resources, like a library of existing cards
- The Right Edge is used to make changes to an active, selected element (such as the card or its fields)

The corners of each edge are special. Controls in the corners can open up panes for either edge, depending on the context.
