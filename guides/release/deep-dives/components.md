The `cardstack` codebase uses Ember to construct the front end application, `cardhost` aka Card Builder.

Most of the work done is in `app/components`. To learn more about the syntax and APIs of components,
visit [Ember's official component guides](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/).
Most other topics within the Ember Guides are not applicable to the Cardstack project,
since cardhost has a custom router, data handling, and build pipeline.
