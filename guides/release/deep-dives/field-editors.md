In this section of the Guides, you will learn how to add a content editing mode to any Card in your project, also known as the Right Edge.

Most websites need a way for users to create new content or modify it. For example, a bank customer updates their contact information, a restaurant owner adds more menu items, and a case manager changes the status of a request.
To handle this, most traditional web apps are littered with forms that are custom-built and individually maintained.

Instead, Cardstack developers get instant content editing tools in the browser, via drag and drop.

### Field modes

When someone is interacting with the Card Builder, they can add new fields to a card when they are in Schema Mode.

If someone needs to add data, such as fill in a form, they would use Edit Mode.

Fields are read-only when they are in View Mode.
