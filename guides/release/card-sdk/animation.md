Animation is an automatic feature of Cards made using the Cardstack Builder.

If you are interested to learn more about our underlying animation libraries
used by the core team of Cardstack developers,
you can check out [`ember-animated`](https://github.com/ember-animation/ember-animated);

In addition, Card authors can use the Card Themer to add their own styles and animation.
Modern CSS can do some pretty amazing things in just a few lines.
