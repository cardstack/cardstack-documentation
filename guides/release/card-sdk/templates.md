_In Hub v2, the custom template system is still under development, so stay tuned for updates! Currently, there is only scaffolding in place for this feature._

Templates are where a developer writes HTML markup and more to display data and organize content.

Whenever you create a card using the Builder, you can drag and drop new fields in, and they form the template for you. You can choose whether a field is part of the card's `isolated` or `embedded` template.
You can think of these as "full size" vs "thumbnail size."
Whenever you make these selections, you are creating your card's template, which can be reused whenever you adopt from the card.
