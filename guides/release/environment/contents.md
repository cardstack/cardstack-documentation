A Cardstack environment is the context that Cards run in. By default, it contains:

- An application that Cards render in
- An API that receives requests from the front end, persists changes, and indexes data from external resources
- Many data plugins for connecting to different kinds of data sources
- UI interfaces for editing content
- A backing data persistence layer, such as a git repository
