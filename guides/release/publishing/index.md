Once you have built something with Cardstack, how can you share it?

Sharing your Card can mean one of the following things:

1. Deploying your Cardstack project to your own server, which uses your Cards
2. Adding your Card to the [Card Catalog](https://github.com/cardstack/card-catalog), a curated collection of many cards that developers can choose from.
3. In the future, publishing your Card to the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/), so that others can install and use it via `yarn install` or `npm install` in their own projects

At Cardstack, we are huge fans of open source software! We are thankful for developers who share their work with the community.
