The Card ecosystem is broad!

A registry of service providers will be built on the Githereum (a git- and Ethereum-based) registry system. It will allow providers who want to offer services in different geographic locations, as well as developers or designers who want to offer consulting services to customers on the network, to list and promote themselves in a way that makes sense to them. This registry will be curated using the CARD token as the native accounting unit and the fee denomination for registry maintenance.
