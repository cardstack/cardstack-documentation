One of the most powerful places you can save a card is in git.

Git is a version control system that helps track changes in codebases (and also data!) across time.
By default, all cards are saved in a git repository, whether in a temporary way while you are testing things out, in a git repository you create on your hard drive, or in a private git repository hosted on GitHub.



<!-- TODO instructions for using a GitHub repo, since the tutorial only covers a local repo -->
