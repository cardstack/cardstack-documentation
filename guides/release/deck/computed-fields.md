A computed field is a property of a Card content-type that can be recalculated as data changes.

The computed field could do complex processing, or something as small as returning whether an `article` has been published/

To learn about work done so far, search the Cardstack repository for `computed` and look at [the tests](https://github.com/cardstack/cardstack/blob/42525205c779cf18e18095c8603909840d81c044/packages/hub/node-tests/computed-test.ts).
