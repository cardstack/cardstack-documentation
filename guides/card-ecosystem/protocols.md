The CARD Protocol unites the Cardstack Ecosystem. It is the economic layer that organizes the buyers and sellers — the customers, retailers, and service providers — and makes the whole network worthwhile for all participants. This tokenized SaaS system will provide end users with the software they need, to do what they need to do, at a great price!
