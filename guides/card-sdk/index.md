_Proposed content: cover what a card is, conceptually. Explain how a card is "full stack" meaning that it defines both presentation and data layers._

When you are authoring a new Cardstack Card it would be easy to think that you
are just building a particular type of component within the contraints of the
Cardstack platform. It is important that you have a clear mental modal of what a
Card is when building a Cardstack application.

## Combination of Data and Presentation
One of the key concepts that is fundamental to the idea of a Cardstack Card is that there is a tight coupling between the data backing a Card and the presentational aspects of a Card. When referring to a card you are talking about the visual elements but also the **data model** that describes the attributes of that Card.
