When building a [card-based system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjJ7jgC1iuk&feature=youtu.be), like a website or an application, you’ll start by creating a Card Deck. A Deck has a clear owner and in this sense is a “local” source of truth.

You build a Deck by importing data into your instance of Cardstack. As you do so, Cardstack’s Deck data model can suggest content types for your data, and give you templates for cards, or “card types,” that can represent your content. You can reuse card types, download them, or build your own.

This is a breakthrough in the way we think about website composition, combining the power of manual line-by-line coding, with the ease of something like simple drag-and-drop.
