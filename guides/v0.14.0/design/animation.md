Animation in Cardstack mirrors the motion and "zoom" of real-life objects.

For example, when you pick up a newspaper and hold it closer, it's as if you have zoomed into the page. When you set the newspaper aside, your eyes follow the motion.

## Animation toolbox for developers

The main tool for developers is to use the embedded and isolated templates
to get automatic animation between states.

Cardstack works great with the [liquid-fire](https://ember-animation.github.io/liquid-fire/) and [ember-animated](https://ember-animation.github.io/ember-animated/) libraries.

Developers may also use regular CSS animation in order to help bring their work to life.
