[git](https://git-scm.com/) is the default data source for Cards.

git has many advantages, including versioning, the ability to compare current and past states, and powerful rollback capabilities.
In a git data source, as something changes, its entire history is preserved.
Data stored using git can be persisted in many different ways, such as in a postgres database or even a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cardstack/cardboard-data), such as that used for the Cardboard demo app.
