CS field is a wrapper component that is used to display data from a card's schema in the card's template. By wrapping the rendering of the a field in cs-field cardstack is able to automatically pickup any editable fields for the editing toolbox. It is also what enables the overlays to render around a field in the render preview of a card when in editor mode.

When developing a new card in most cases you do not need to use the {{cs-field}} component directly because of a code-generator that makes this step automatic. Code generators are another type that is automatically discovered by the DI system in cardstack.
