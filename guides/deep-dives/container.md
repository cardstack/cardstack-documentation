If you have a quick look in the [@cardstack/di](https://github.com/cardstack/cardstack/tree/master/packages/di) package you can see that the Cardstack Container and Registry actually extend the Glimmer Container and Registry. This means that if you have a type defined in the system you can get access to it using something like `env.lookup('hub:searchers')` which would get all the `searchers` registered in the system.
