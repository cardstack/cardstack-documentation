These work-in-progress documentation resources provide a high level overview of features, the project architecture, how to use Cardstack to power your own creations, and some pointers for developers who are working on the framework itself.

## What is Cardstack?

Cardstack is an open source framework that enables Web 3.0. “Cards” form the building blocks that allow for bringing in data from disparate sources, beautiful UI animations, encapsulated and flexible data schemas, and a quick ramp-up experience. Both JavaScript developers and end-users are empowered to add common application features (CMS, notifications, authentication).

Cardstack is a full-stack development environment, meaning that it spans everything from the front-end browser experience, to API layers, to the database and caching. Under the hood, it makes use of other libraries such as Node, Koa, Ember.js, and postgres, but someone does not need to know those tools in order to build something of their own using Cardstack.

## Why use Cardstack?

To understand what Cardstack can do, and why we think of it as the next generation web experience, it is helpful to first take a look at the status quo for the web. Most serious applications have to tie together many different data sources into a unified experience, and it is a struggle. A traditional web app focuses first on what goes _inside_ a widget, and adds nonstandard code around the edges to patch everything together. There's major friction between the front end, back end, database, and third party APIs. Once you string it all together, and try to make changes, everything breaks.

In a typical web app, too much is hard coded... but it doesn't have to be this way.

In contrast, Cardstack's features focus on streamlining interoperability, whether between Cards, data sources, or even syncing data across decentralized systems. Its plugin system, runtime codegens, API scheme, and caching system let you connect with APIs in a way that is flexible and scalable.

## About these Guides

These pages are not designed to be very detailed *API documentation. Cardstack is pre-1.0, so there may be some inconsistencies in the documentation, and APIs are subject to change as we iterate, explore, and build new features.
